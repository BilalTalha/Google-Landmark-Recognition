# Google Landmark Recognition

## Introduction

This repository contains code for the Google Landmark Recognition challenge, which involves building a machine learning model that can identify the landmark depicted in a given image. The challenge is based on a dataset of over 1 million images from around the world.

## Usage

To run the code, clone the repository and navigate to the `src` directory. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `google_landmark_recognition.ipynb`. This notebook contains all the code required to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
